# ðŸ§  RNN Fundamentals: Simple RNN Structure & Word Embeddings

This repository contains basic implementations of **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** . It is divided into two major parts:

1. **Simple RNN Structure:** A hands-on demonstration of how a basic RNN operates with sequential data.
2. **Embeddings with RNN:** Integration of embedding layers with RNNs for handling natural language/text inputs.\

ðŸ§¬ 2. RNN with Embeddings (rnn_with_embeddings.py)
This script demonstrates:
1.Using nn.Embedding to convert word indices into dense vector representations
2.Feeding the embedded inputs into an nn.RNN layer
3.Processing sequences such as sentences or phrases
Use Case: A great starting point for NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, text generation, or sequence labeling.

ðŸ“– Learning Outcomes
By exploring this repository, you'll understand:
1.The core logic of RNNs
2.How hidden states evolve over time
3.How word embeddings improve NLP model performance
4.Integration of embedding layers in sequence models
